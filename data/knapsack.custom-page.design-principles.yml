          1. Highlight our customer's brand before our own -- We're proud of our
          application, but we want to use it to make our customer proud of
          theirs.

          2. Strong opinions, loosely held -- Show people the way we think is
          right, but gracefully get out of the way when someone disagrees.

          3. Maintain control -- With great power comes great responsibility.
          Users need to feel like they can control how their system changes.
