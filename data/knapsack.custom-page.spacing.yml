        ## Applying spacing

        The spacing scale can be applied to <code>margin</code> or
        <code>padding</code> properties, as well as to both vertical and
        horizontal edges. The token takes the place of the values normally
        assigned to <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code>. The following
        are all approved ways to syntactically apply DDS spacing tokens:


        ````html

        margin: $spacing-03;

        margin: $spacing-03 $spacing-01;

        margin: $spacing-07 0 $spacing-04 0;

        margin-right: $spacing-05;

        padding: $spacing-04;

        padding: $spacing-05 $spacing-03;

        padding: $spacing-07 $spacing-04 0 $spacing-04;

        ````

        ### Spacing scale

        Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes
        small increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for
        detail-level designs. This scale is applied and used within all Carbon
        components.

        ## Designing with space

        Every part of a UI should be intentional including the empty space
        between elements. The amount of space between items creates
        relationships and hierarchy.


        ### Creating relationships

        Elements in a design that are near each other are seen as being
        meaningfully related. As more space is added between elements, their
        perceived relationship weakens.


        Patterns created through spacing can also create relationships. Elements
        arranged in the same spacing pattern are seen as related pieces that
        have equal weight.


        Space can also be used to denote groups of associated information. This
        creates content sections on a page without having to use lines or other
        graphical elements as a divider.


        ### Creating hierarchy

        Elements that have more spacing around them tend to be perceived as
        higher in importance than elements that have less space around them.
        Take this page for instance. The top level headers have more space
        surrounding them giving them focus and prominence. Then as the headers
        descend in importance they receive less space, signaling they are
        subordinate.


        Elements that are set close to each other can be easily overlooked.
        Users may see the grouping but not process each individual item.
        Therefore, if you have an element or content of high importance on the
        page, consider giving it extra surrounding space to help it attract
        focus.


        ### White space

        Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It can
        be used to break up sections on a page or to help create focus on
        certain element(s). White space helps with information processing; too
        much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a user.
        Sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should not
        be crowded; there should be white space to let the user’s eye rest.

        ## FAQ

        #### Are spacing increments outside of the scale allowed?

        There are always exceptions to the rule, but deviating from the spacing
        scales should be avoided whenever possible.


        #### Can I still use the Carbon grid for horizontal spacing?

        Yes, in fact it’s encouraged.


        #### Can I still use percentages for spacing?

        Percentages like 50% (1/2) or 33% (1/3) are still acceptable ways to
        divide a page. Percentages can all still be used to control max and min
        widths. However, using percentages for padding or margin inside of a
        component or element should be avoided (ex. <code>padding-right:
        10%</code>). The exception to this is if you’re applying it to fit the
        5% grid margins.


        #### Are the spacing tokens responsive?

        No, the tokens themselves do not change values based on the screen size.
        However, it is acceptable at page breakpoints to jump a step(s) on the
        spacing scale to fit spacing needs (i.e., at 1440 px
        <code>padding-right: $spacing-05</code> but at breakpoint 768px
        <code>padding-right: $spacing-03</code>).

  Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. DDS
  takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers deliver clear,
  functional layouts.
