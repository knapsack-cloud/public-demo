          ## Overview

          Use card layouts to present a high-level summary of content related to
          a single topic. 


          ### Do:

          * Consider and choose text and visual elements carefully. Test your
          cards with the minimal content and only add additional content or
          graphics where they give needed context to the user

          * Use headlines that set clear expectations about the content being
          linked to

          * Use one style of card per module, don't mix and match

          * Feature one piece of information per card

          * Outline the main idea with the minimal possible information, don't
          overload with information as the card links to more detail


          ### Do not:

          * Mix card styles within the same module

          * Overload with information as the card links to more detail

          * Add inline text links, the card itself is clickable and should link
          to a single piece of information, consider using content blocks in
          this instance

          ### When to avoid

          Cards should only display enough information to give a user context.
          Do not use a card layout:

          * to highlight a solo piece of information

          * when the content requires in-line or multiple links, consider
          content blocks

          * when a large amount of text is needed to give users context 


          ### Keep content concise

          Cards allow users to scan content in order to find their required
          information quickly, therefore it is important to make the content
          concise. Ensure the headlines are brief and explicit about the content
          the cards link to. Intuitive headlines and copy help the user build a
          clear mental model of the content.
