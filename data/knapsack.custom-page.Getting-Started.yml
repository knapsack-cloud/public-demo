        ## Welcome

        Welcome to your Knapsack workspace! As you get acclimated, follow the
        guidance below to try out the key features available to you.


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 1: Personalize your profile


        Knapsack is all about cross functional collaboration around your code.
        Personalizing your profile will help your team interact with you, so add
        a profile picture and your display name.


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 2: Set up to run Knapsack locally

        [Use the documentation
        here](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/31-running-knapsack-locally)
        for step-by-step instructions. 


        *Not a developer? Take a look at Step 6 and onward. There are sample
        patterns in this workspace to get you going even without developer
        help.*


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 3: Explore the connected code repository

        Weâ€™ve set you up with a GitHub repository that has some starter patterns
        to get you going: components, tokens and a page prototype example. Poke
        around the repo and use these starter patterns to get comfortable with
        how Knapsack works, then add your own code using Steps 4 and 5, below. 


        To connect your workspace to a different repo, [contact Knapsack
        Customer Success](mailto:help@knapsack.cloud).



        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 4: Add / Change design tokens

        Once you have Knapsack running locally, navigate to the
        /src/design-tokens/ directory, where you can find, modify and add to the
        source design token files. Try modifying or adding token values to see
        how they reflect in the Cloud UI.


        Refer to the [Help documentation
        here](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/32-adding-changing-design-tokens)
        for step by step instructions.


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 5: Add your own components

        Try adding a component of your own to see how you can work with it in
        the Cloud UI. Don't have components handy? Try modifying the sample
        comonents and see how the changes render in the Pattern Playground.


        Refer to the [Help documentation
        here](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/20-connecting-code-templates-to-a-pattern-page)
        for step-by-step instructions.


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 6: Add / Change documentation

        Test out some of the core uses cases and workflows available via your
        Knapsack Cloud workspace:

        * Add to and change navigation structure

        * Add and change content via content blocks

        * Create pattern example (using demo content if necessary)

        <br>

        <br>


        Refer to the [Help documentation
        here](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/33-adding-a-documentation-page)
        for step-by-step instructions.


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 7: Propose a change (Cloud UI only)

        The Propose Change feature - available from the gear icon - allows
        non-technical team members to contribute changes made via the Cloud UI
        to your design system in the form of a git pull request (PR). 


        *Note: Developers working locally do not need to use the Propose Change
        feature, as they are able to merge code edits (whether made manually or
        via the local environment) directly into the git repo.*


        Refer to the [Help documentation
        here](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/25-proposing-a-change) for
        instructions. 


        <br>

        <br>


        ### Step 8: Share, collaborate and grow!

        Now that you're starting to make this workspace your own, add
        collaborators and continue to build out your processes for working *on*
        and *with* your design system using your Knapsack workspace.
