          ## Applying spacing

          The spacing scale can be applied to <code>margin</code> or
          <code>padding</code> properties, as well as to both vertical and
          horizontal edges. The token takes the place of the values normally
          assigned to <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code>. The
          following are all approved ways to syntactically apply spacing tokens:


          ```scss

          margin: $spacing-03;

          margin: $spacing-03 $spacing-01;

          margin: $spacing-07 0 $spacing-04 0;

          margin-right: $spacing-05;

          padding: $spacing-04;

          padding: $spacing-05 $spacing-03;

          padding: $spacing-07 $spacing-04 0 $spacing-04;

          ```

          ### Spacing scale

          Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes
          small increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships
          for detail-level designs. This scale is applied and used within all
          components.

          ## Designing with space

          Every part of a UI should be intentional including the empty space
          between elements. The amount of space between items creates
          relationships and hierarchy.


          ### Creating relationships

          Elements in a design that are near each other are seen as being
          meaningfully related. As more space is added between elements, their
          perceived relationship weakens.


          Patterns created through spacing can also create relationships.
          Elements arranged in the same spacing pattern are seen as related
          pieces that have equal weight.


          Space can also be used to denote groups of associated information.
          This creates content sections on a page without having to use lines or
          other graphical elements as a divider.


          ### Creating hierarchy

          Elements that have more spacing around them tend to be perceived as
          higher in importance than elements that have less space around them.
          Take this page for instance. The top level headers have more space
          surrounding them giving them focus and prominence. Then as the headers
          descend in importance they receive less space, signaling they are
          subordinate.


          Elements that are set close to each other can be easily overlooked.
          Users may see the grouping but not process each individual item.
          Therefore, if you have an element or content of high importance on the
          page, consider giving it extra surrounding space to help it attract
          focus.


          ### White space

          Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It
          can be used to break up sections on a page or to help create focus on
          certain element(s). White space helps with information processing; too
          much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a user.
          Sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should
          not be crowded; there should be white space to let the user’s eye
          rest.

  Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. Use
  spacing tokens to help designers deliver clear, functional layouts.
