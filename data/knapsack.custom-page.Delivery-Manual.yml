        ### Changing how we design services

        A service is any activity that helps someone complete a task. With that
        in mind, all public servants – whether they work in digital,
        communications, policy or operations – are involved in designing
        services.


        Services are groups of transactions, activities or information that work
        together. They might take place online or offline.


        Digital services often require people to go through the service in the
        way that product team designs it, and often this design is not simple or
        easy to follow.


        A service may need smaller products to meet user needs. If these
        products are delivered by different parts of the ecosystem that are
        working in different ways it can make it harder for the user to do what
        they need to do.


        This is why we need to design together to deliver the whole experience.

        ### The delivery process

        Following the service design process will help your team build services
        that solve a real customer need, based on evidence. Following the
        process from beginning to end will also help you meet expectations both
        internally and externally.

        ### How the process helps

        This process will help you design services that are:

        * **human-centred** (engaging and learning from the people who will use
        the service throughout the process)

        * **evidence-based** (based on data and user research, not opinions)

        * **iterative** (continually building on past learning)

        <br>

        </br>


        The service design process typically involves:

        * exploring the problem and identifying issues through **in-depth
        research**

        * narrowing in on **key insights** that will inform the design

        * **brainstorming** several ways to solve the identified issues

        * **prototyping and testing** potential design ideas to gauge their
        impact

        * planning the **features and capabilities** the service needs to
        deliver

        * **iterating** the solution and repeating the process

        <br>

        </br>


        Following proven service design methods can help you meet the needs of
        users and the organisation while avoiding common project pitfalls.
