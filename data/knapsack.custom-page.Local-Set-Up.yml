        ### Development set up

        We have created a starter kit with templates that can get you up and
        running with the design system. You can go to the starter kit GitHub
        repository to download the code.


        To run the design system locally requires Node.js version 8 or higher.
        See the [Node.js/npm installation
        guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#install-npm--manage-npm-versions)s
        if you require assistance installing node.


        1. Download the starter kit and unzip into your chosen development
        folder.

        2. In terminal open this folder and run <code>npm install</code>. This
        will install dependencies necessary for the local development
        environment.

        3. You can now start your local server by running <code>npm run
        dev</code>.

        This will check for file changes, when it occurs the server will build
        your site refresh the browser.

        ### How it works

        In your directory you have a package.json file. This file points to
        dependencies that are installed when <code>npm install</code> is run.
        When you run <code>npm install</code> all of the design system
        components and additional packages related to the local development
        environment are added to the <code>node_modules/</code> folder.


        When the user runs <code>npm run build</code> or <code>npm run
        dev</code> we use [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)
        to convert the <code>src/main.scss</code> file into the
        <code>dist/css/main.css</code> file.
        [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) is run after
        compilation to add vendor prefixes to the <code>main.css</code> file.
        Refer to the <code>package.json</code> scripts for how this has been set
        up.


        This set up allows you to modify the variables in the design system file
        from the <code>src/global/scss/settings.scss</code> file. You change the
        typography and spacing by updating the .scss files in
        <code>src/global/scss/tools/</code> folder. Changes to these files will
        be injected into your browser so you donâ€™t even need to refresh thanks
        to [Browser Sync](https://www.browsersync.io/).


        The dist folder contains all the files required to publish a website.
        The index.html file references the main.css file and main.js assets to
        generate the page. 


        To start using other components you can copy paste the HTML code
        snippets from the documentation in this site into the
        <code>index.html</code> or other <code>html</code> file that you may
        have created.
