        The Demo Design System is new to many and is always evolving. We
        encourage you to use this time to become familiar with it. Ask your
        teams to get involved – your product managers, developers, writers and
        designers. Make this a team effort as you acclimate to using this system


        ### Start with the standards

        Explore the six design standards to get an idea how you or your team
        might put them into practice for your digital product or service.


        Each standard is made up of topics that outline best practice and policy
        requirements. They indicate:


        * the minimum you're expected to do to meet a standard

        * how to show you’ve done that in a checklist format. You could use this
        to report to stakeholders, and for your showcases and record keeping 

        * orientation guidance and methods to help get you, and keep you, on
        track.


        Your team can also also view the standards, with each topic broken down
        into a project phases checklist.

        ### Take an agile approach to delivery

        Use the Delivery Manual to ensure your team builds a service that solves
        a real customer need, and makes decisions based on evidence. It will
        help you meet the needs of users and the organisation while avoiding
        common project pitfalls.


        Taking this approach to designing and delivering products and services
        can be new for some teams - so use the manual to help team members and
        stakeholders agree on the ways you'll work together.

        ### Styles, patterns, solutions

        Explore our Design System Figma UI kit. The design system styles,
        patterns and solutions make it easy for agencies to reskin, improve upon
        or start a site from scratch. You have all the tools to make your
        product, service or website distinctly NSW Government.


        Get your development started with the HTML Starter Kit alternatively you
        can either download the full source code from our github repository or
        use our npm library.

        ### Building on the basics

        Our team continues to build the resources you need. We ensure our
        product is on-brand and accessible, based on the standards. We work with
        an agile delivery approach, putting you, our agency users first, and
        testing and iterating as we go.


        We’ve been working with several agencies to consolidate and strengthen
        our standards and toolkit and will continue along these lines. We plan
        to ensure they’re practical with case studies, examples and templates.

        ### Who’s using the Demo Design System?

        It’s great to see several agencies currently in the process of using the
        design system. We will publish their examples here once they go live.


        Meanwhile, this site is an example of the design system in action.
