          ## Knapsack now supports private / hidden pages!


          Pages or Groups marked as hidden in the knapsack.navs.json file will
          not appear in the navigation to Viewer users or public site visitors,
          but will be accessible via direct URL and navigable by Admins and
          Editors.
