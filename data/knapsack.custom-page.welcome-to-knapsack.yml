          # Go further faster

          Knapsack enables enterprise engineering, product, and design teams to
          build better products faster by bringing all teams together around
          production code and engineering workflows.


          **Knapsack allows teams to do four main things:**


          1. Organize your design assets around patterns

          2. Connect to your code to be able to view and manipulate components

          3. Document usage guidelines, history, examples, and other information

          4. Ship a version controlled package of code and tools for use in
          building applications

          # About Us

          We're a passionate group of designers, engineers, and former design
          system consultants. Our team has helped some of the largest companies
          build and implement design systems that solve their unique challenges.
          Our mission is to simplify the design system experience so teams can
          spend more time creating and less time rebuilding or struggling to
          keep their design and code in sync. 


          We're backed by Google, Slack, and other world-class investors who see
          our vision for the future. 


          Our focus is modernizing digital production through collaborative
          tooling and workflows that **make it easy to reuse code**.
