        ## Introduction

        Application of the color palette brings a unified and recognizable
        consistency to a vast array of digital products and interfaces. This
        consistency is grounded by a set of well-defined rules on how to work
        with the Demo Design System pattern library in the context of dark and
        light themes.

        ## Color anatomy

        Demo Design System's default themes are derived from our Design Language
        color palette. The Neutral Gray family is dominant in the default
        themes, making use of subtle shifts in value to help organize content
        into distinct zones.


        The core Blue family serves as the primary action color across all
        products and experiences. Additional colors are used sparingly and
        purposefully.

        ## Tokens

        Color is managed using color tokens. Tokens are a method of abstracting
        color by role or usage, independent of the actual color values. For
        example, instead of needing to code all instances of input labels in a
        UI to be <code>#565656</code>, the form component in Carbon specifies
        the token <code>$text-02</code> for these labels, and that token is
        specified in a separate theme file to be <code>#565656</code>. For a
        different theme, that same text-02 token could be mapped to a different
        hex value, like <code>#ffffff</code>. Thus, tokens not only allow for
        more efficient color updates within a theme, but also enable any UI (or
        portion of a UI) built with DDS to easily switch between different
        themes.


        A single token can be associated with multiple roles, but only if the
        color value is used consistently across those roles. This allows for
        uniform color application across themes while maintaining full styling
        flexibility.

  Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces demands extended
  guidance around color usage. The following concepts are the foundation as we
  strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface design.
