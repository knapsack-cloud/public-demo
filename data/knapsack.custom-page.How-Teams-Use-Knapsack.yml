        ### Pattern Inventory

        Connect existing design and code assets to create a central view of all
        the elements that already exist and are in use across the product
        team(s) today.


        ### Experience Planning

        Browse available assets and experiences to identify what you can use or
        iterate on to build the experience you need


        ### Design Annotation

        Annotate designs in terms of what is being **reused**, **modified**, and
        **created** - using links to Knapsack to help Engineers quickly
        reference reusable elements they can work with to speed up production.


        ### Pattern Prototyping

        Combine patterns and configure props to create production-quality
        implementations using the system - all from the web. Share with
        colleagues to get feedabck and iterate fast.


        ### Component Logging, Handoff, Collaboration

        Whether starting from Engineering or Design, teams can contribute source
        assets (Figma frames, JS templates, etc.) as they work, creating a
        central space for collaboration on the system as it evolves.


        ### Development Playground

        Use Knapsack locally to get instant feedback as you develop or evolve
        your components. No need to build or publish in order to see, use and
        share it.


        ### Testing Infrastructure

        Implement system-level testing using Knapsack endpoints. Each component
        variation configured in Knapsack is available to use with external
        testing tools.


        ### Token Management

        Power cross-platform applications from a single token source, complete
        with dynamic documentation and web-based token editing.
