          # What's the story behind
          ![](https://knapsack.imgix.net/site/demo-design-system/group-19-hc_satlrxo.svg?w=300)?


          We're a passionate group of designers, engineers, and former design
          system consultants. Our team has helped some of the largest companies
          build and implement design systems that solve their unique challenges.
          **With over 75 years of combined DS experience**, our mission is to
          simplify the design system experience so teams can spend more time
          creating and less time rebuilding or struggling to keep their design
          and code in sync. 


          We're backed by Google, Slack, and other world-class investors who see
          our vision for the future. 


          Our focus is modernizing digital production through collaborative
          tooling and workflows that **make it easy to reuse code**.
