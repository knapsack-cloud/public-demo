          ## Introduction to Publishing in Knapsack

          Knapsack leverages the features of Git for managing contribution,
          versioning, and collaboration in the workspace. In order to publish
          content from the web, you'll follow the same tried and trusted Git
          workflows, but from a simplified interface.

          ## Making Edits to the Workspace

          In order to begin making changes, an Admin or Contributor first needs
          to create or select a branch in which to work. 

          * Branches can be created using the **Edit** button located in the top
          admin toolbar. 

          * Existing branches can be selected by clicking the branches dropdown
          (defaulted to "latest").

          ## Publishing or Submitting Changes

          #### Kicking off the Publishing workflow

          1. Click the **Publish Changes** or **Request Review** button in the
          top toolbar

          2. Enter a **Title** and **Body** for the submission. This content
          will be included in the pull request (PR) containing your changes in
          the underlying code repo


          #### Changes Appearing on Production

          Changes may take up to 10 minutes to appear on production depending on
          your workspace configuration. This sllows time for all code changes
          (e.g. design tokens that will produce updated CSS) to go through a
          build and deploy process and release an udpated version of your design
          system and workspace.

          ## Permission Levels

          Knapsack's contribution features support different permissions based
          on user role within the platform:

          #### Admins 

          Admin users have the option of merging changes into production
          ("Publish") or submitting changes for review ("Request Review")  by
          other team members or system administrators.
        - >-
          #### Contributors

          Contributor users are only able to "Request Review" of their changes.
          They are not able to publish changes directly. Once changes are
          submitted, Admin users can publish the changes via the UI.

          #### Viewers

          Viewer users (or public workspace visitors) are unable to make or
          submit any changes to the workspace.
