        ### A distinctly Demo Design System

        **Demo Design System** patterns apply reusable UI design elements that
        are distinctly for demos out of the box. They have been carefully
        considered and tested to meet the needs of digital creators when
        developing user-centred products and services.


        The Design System patterns are available as design assets in Figma and
        in production-ready code. They are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA
        accessibility guidelines.

        The Design System Figma UI Kit has been built as a Figma Project, to
        share the Project with your Figma account we share it with your Figma
        email address. This will allow the files to be accessible from your
        Dashboard.


        You’ll receive confirmation via email and in the notification section of
        your Figma account that the file has been shared with you. **Once you
        have access you can share it with other members in your team from within
        your Figma account:**


        1. From your Figma Dashboard, select the ‘Demo Design System’ Project in
        your left-hand panel (do not share from within the file as this will
        limit access) 

        2. Select ‘Share’ in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

        3. Enter the email address you wish to share within the ‘Invite
        someone…’ text field and click ‘Send invite’.

        4. Your invited user will receive notification via email and in the
        notification section of their Figma account.

        5. A full log of changes for this release is available in the Figma
        document and on Github.


        To view the UI Kit without it being added to your account, you can
        access the [View Only Design System Figma UI
        Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/PVrERKnckLTlJSPk12gbtS/NSW-Digital-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1).

        in your Figma account under ‘Shared Projects’.

        3. Open the file to view the style and pattern guidelines under ‘Pages’
        in the Layers Panel.

        4. Open your working file or a new file and add the ‘Demo Digital Design
        System’ as an Asset Library (see ‘How to use as a design library’ on the
        Welcome page)

        5. If you are **not** adding a brand custom highlight colour, please

        6. If you **are** adding a brand custom highlight colour, follow the
        instructions to add the highlight colour on the ‘Typography / Colour’

        ### Get started with Figma

        We know that implementing new software can have its challenges, so we
        want to support your move to Figma at a pace that suits you and your
        team.


        If you are ready to start with Figma, we recommend dipping your toes in
        slowly with small projects and connecting with our Community to share
        experiences and ask questions.


        Figma has developed some easy to follow
        [Guides](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Get-started#Get-Started)
        and [Video
        Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA)
        that step you through different processes:

        </br>

        #### Sketch is still available

        The last update to Sketch was the Version 2.6 release. As we continue to
        extend the Design System and bring in your contributions, the Sketch
        file may no longer contain all the available components and patterns.
        Using Sketch might still work for your team if you are looking to
        produce Hi-fidelity mockups that look and function close to what you
        envision the end product to be - but if you have the opportunity to
        start planning how you might migrate to using the Figma UI Kit, check
        out the section below on moving from Sketch to Figma. 


        Need further guidance? Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with the
        Design System Team at help@knapsack.cloud to ask how we can help.

        #### Moving from Sketch to Figma

        If you are currently using Sketch, Figma allows you to [import Sketch
        files into your Figma
        account](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040514273-Import-files-from-Sketch).
        The importer keeps your layers intact and even brings over your symbols
        as components. You may need to make some small adjustments to components
        if they don’t convert perfectly but these should be minimal.


        Figma has put together a quick guide on how you can import your Sketch
        files into Figma, so you don't have to start your projects from scratch.
        They have also put together an article outlining [What’s different and
        Tips for
        migrating](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/what-to-expect-when-moving-from-sketch-to-figma/tips-and-tricks-for-the-move/).
