        ### What is it?

        The **Demo Design System** provides a sample environment of how teams
        set organize their design systems within Knapsack. 




        ### Who's it for?

        * Individuals or teams who seek direction and guidance to achieve a
        desired outcome. You’re eager to up-skill your teams in user-centred
        design to a level of confidence. You would like to work with others to
        avoid mistakes. 


        * Teams with digital maturity who want to know the mandatory and minimum
        requirements. You want to reduce development time and cost, deliver a
        consistent whole experience, and share what you learn with the
        community. 


        * Contractors and suppliers who need to know what’s mandatory to deliver
        products and services for dmonstrations. You need to know about styles
        and UI patterns to design a distinctly demo-focused product. 


        We're always asking for input from demo experts across industries, so
        that our system is best practice and relevant. Please never hesitate to
        [propose your
        ideas](https://help.knapsack.cloud/article/25-proposing-a-change) via
        this platform.
