        ## Introduction

        Getting value from a design system isn't about crafting and releasing
        the perfect, complete library into the wild. It's about starting to work
        in a more systematic way **today**. 


        Knapsack provides a place to document your design system - through
        dynamic connections to the source - as you design and build. This means
        you can organically build and start using your system without constantly
        trying to carve out time for a separate work stream.


        See below for recommendations on where to start:

        * [For
        Engineers](https://app.knapsack.cloud/site/workspace-starter/latest/pages/intro#engineers)

        * [For
        Designers](https://app.knapsack.cloud/site/workspace-starter/latest/pages/intro#designers)

        * [For Cross-Functional
        Teams](https://app.knapsack.cloud/site/workspace-starter/latest/pages/intro#cross-functional-workflow-example)


        We've also included some [sample design tokens and
        components](https://app.knapsack.cloud/site/workspace-starter/latest/pages/intro#sample-patterns)
        for reference as you get started.

        ### Connect Design Tokens


        Knapsack provides both dynamic documentation and cross-platform
        transforms for your design tokens, making it a turnkey solution for many
        of your token management needs. To get started quickly, add or modify
        tokens to start building out your core styles.


        Once your tokens are connected: 


        - Engineers across web and native platforms will be able to leverage the
        tokens and any styles you create to power their products immediately.

        - Designers and other non-engineers will be able to review, copy, and
        even propose changes to token values and metadata using the web UI.


        ### Connect the Components You Build


        Each time you build or reference a component for a UI you're building,
        ensure it is connected to Knapsack for reference and reuse.


        If a component isn't yet documented connect it using the following
        steps: (working locally)


        1. **Find or Add a Page** – Find the existing Pattern Page with the
        design asset. If it doesn't exist, add a new Pattern Page to Knapsack.

        2. **Add Usage Guidelines** – Add Engineering Usage Guidelines using the
        Markdown content block.

        3. **Add a Code Tab** – Add a Code Tab to the page, selecting the proper
        renderer.

        4. **Connect the Source Template** – Add the package path and namespace
        for the pattern.

        5. **Define the API** – Infer or document the pattern API spec

        5. **Update Statuses** – Adjust the statuses to reflect the components
        current status

        6. **Commit the Change** – Merge your code / submit a PR for the Design
        System team to review


        As your team builds the library in Knapsack, you'll have a central place
        to reference what exists in both design and code, making the Knapsack
        workspace a great place to start your engineering planning.

        ### Document the Component You Use


        Each time you have a UI design ready for hand-off to engineering, go
        through and ensure each design system element is documented in
        Knapsack. 


        If a component is already documented, include a link to the Knapsack
        page for your engineer to reference or contribute to.


        If a component isn't yet documented, add the page using the following
        steps:


        1. **Find or Add a Page** – Find the existing Pattern Page with the
        coded pattern. If it doesn't exist, add a new Pattern Page to Knapsack.

        2. **Locate Source Design Asset** – Copy the 'share link' for the design
        component (e.g. Figma component). If you use a platform that doesn't
        support live embeds, provide a link or directions to where the source
        file can be found, along with an image showing how it appears for
        designers.

        3. **Add Design Asset** – Add the relevant 'Embed' content block (e.g.
        Figma, Xd, Framer, Abstract) or a generic iFrame embed and adjust the
        settings for proper display.

        4. **Add Guidelines** – Add Design Usage Guidelines using the Markdown
        content block

        5. **Update Statuses** – Adjust the statuses to reflect the components
        current status

        6. **Propose a Change** – Submit the update as a PR for the Design
        System team to review


        As your team builds the library in Knapsack, you'll have a central place
        to reference what exists in both design and code, making the Knapsack
        workspace a great place to start your design planning.

        ## Cross-Functional Workflow Example


        ### **Centering Workflow Around a Component (e.g. Button)**


        1. **Create a Page** – Design creates page in Knapsack

        2. **Add Designs & Guidelines** – Design adds designs (e.g. Figma asset)
        + usage guidelines; proposes a change

        3. **Define Design Tokens (optional)** – Engineering defines tokens in
        Knapsack

        4. **Build Component** – Engineering builds component, incorporating
        system-provided tokens + styles (if defined)

        5. **Connect Component** – Engineering connects component to Knapsack,
        configures props

        6. **Create Examples** – Design creates coded variations using Knapsack
        playground

        7. **Publish the System** – Engineering publishes npm package of system
        contents + docs for product engineers to leverage
