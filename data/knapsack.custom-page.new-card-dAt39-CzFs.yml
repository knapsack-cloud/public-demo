          ## Do:

          * Consider and choose text and visual elements carefully. Test your
          cards with the minimal content and only add additional content or
          graphics where they give needed context to the user

          * Use headlines that set clear expectations about the content being
          linked to

          * Use one style of card per module, don't mix and match

          * Feature one piece of information per card

          * Outline the main idea with the minimal possible information, don't
          overload with information as the card links to more detail
