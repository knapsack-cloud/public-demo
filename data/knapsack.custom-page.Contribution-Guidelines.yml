        ## Creating a New Component

        Websites have different user needs and the Design System is constantly
        changing. To meet these user needs you may have to create your own
        components.


        When creating new components it is important to use the inbuilt
        functionality and core distinctly Demo look and feel of the Design
        System. The components, grid system, variables and functions have been
        created to help to simplify this process. Using the inbuilt
        functionality ensures changes to the system and changes you make will
        naturally flow into your own custom components.  Another key benefit of
        leveraging existing code standards is maintaining a high level of
        accessibility required for all demonstration digital products and
        services.

        ### Do the research first

        If you are in the process of making a new component make sure it is
        something your user needs. Often times simple solutions are the most
        usable.


        We like to ask these questions before making new components:

        * Is it possible to use an existing component?

        * Is it possible to meet this user need by customising an existing
        component?


        If you can't use or modify an existing component we ask:

        * Is it possible to use components that exist to make this ( grid,
        buttons, responsive-media, body )?

        * Can we build this component in a way that other products can benefit
        from it in the future?

        * Is there research or discussion about similar patterns on the
        community?

        * What existing functions and variables can I use in this component?

        ### Make a contribution
         
        We welcome any contributions from the community and beyond to help
        improve our services.  You can find a comprehensive guide to making
        contributions on our github site. In summary, we ask the following for
        all contributions:

        *  **Useful** - It addresses a user need that’s shared by multiple
        services or products.

        *  **Unique** - It doesn’t duplicate something which already exists in
        the design system, unless it’s intended to replace it.

        *  **Distinctly Demo** - Suggested patterns and components must be
        aligned to the distinctly Demo look and feel. Download the latest
        [Design System Figma UI
        kit](https://app.knapsack.cloud/site/ks-demo-bootstrap/latest/pages/Design-System-Figma-UI-kit)
        from our site.

        *  **Usable** - It’s been tested and shown to work with a representative
        sample of users, including those with disabilities.

        *  **Consistent** - It uses existing styles and components in the design
        system where relevant.

        *  **Versatile** - It can be easily applied in different contexts.

        *  **Tested** - It’s been tested and shown to work with a range of
        browsers, assistive technologies and devices.

        *  **Considered** - Documentation and rationale have been provided.
