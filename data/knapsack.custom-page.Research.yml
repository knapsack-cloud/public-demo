        A lot of exciting research projects are happening across the Product
        Demo field, but there’s currently no easy way for teams to share their
        research with others. We know that research is being stored in different
        places by different teams across industries and teams, and often only
        gets used once. As a result, teams across world may be working on
        similar problems without even knowing it.


        We've started doing some research on how we could solve this problem.
        We're still in the early stages of researching the problem, but we think
        an open user research repository for demo-focused teams could help.

        ### We’re not reinventing the wheel  

        There are a number of research repositories already in existence that
        we’re looking to for inspiration. These repositories aren’t just
        government, they’re also being used by universities and industry.


        A few examples are:

        * Hackney Council's open [user research
        library](https://research.localgov.digital/)

        * Universities across the globe have had open research repositories for
        many years

        * Global companies like Airbnb, Intrepid and Polaris have also built
        internal user research repositories

        ### Want to get involved? 

        We're doing some user research sessions and would love to hear from
        anyone able to participate in a session. We'd especially like to speak
        to user researchers, service designers, business analysts and product
        managers who are working in government or with government. If that's
        you, please get in touch with us at help@knapsack.cloud.


        If you’ve got your own research repository, are thinking about
        establishing one, or just love user research and want to chat with
        likeminded people, get in touch with us, we’d love to hear from you.
